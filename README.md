# Review App

A modern feedback/review application built with **React** and **Vite**. This project demonstrates advanced React concepts such as props drilling, the Context API, and dynamic theming. Users can add, view, and delete feedback, with a responsive UI and theme toggle (light/dark mode).

## Features

- **Add Feedback:** Users can submit feedback with validation (minimum 10 characters).
- **Feedback List:** Displays all feedback entries with delete functionality.
- **Feedback Count:** Shows the total number of feedback items.
- **Theme Toggle:** Switch between light and dark modes; preference is saved in `localStorage`.
- **Advanced React Patterns:**
  - **Props Drilling:** Demonstrated in component hierarchy.
  - **Context API:** Used for global state management (feedback data and theme).
- **Reusable Components:** Button and Card components for consistent UI.
- **Responsive Design:** Clean and adaptable layout.
